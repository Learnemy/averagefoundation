           <p>Average. Did I just call you ‚Äúaverage people‚Äù? The audacity! Why yes I did. But let me explain while you grab a drink and get comfy.</p>

          <p>We all grew up on stories of princes, princesses, and superheroes, that only <i>the chosen one</i> can do good and save the world. These chosen ones display extraordinary qualities of bravery, intelligence, or actual superpowers, and everyone else who're not chosen are just... inconsequential.</p>

          <p>But most of us are not <i>the chosen one</i>. Most of us will not win a Nobel prize, cure COVID-19, or have millions in the bank.</p>

          <p>Most of us are just... average.*</p>

          <p>So what does this leaves us? Do we strive to become heroes before we can do some good or throw our hands up in despair?</p>

          <p><b>Answer: No, we can do good wherever and whoever we are.</b> But yes, put your hands up and wave them in the air. üôå</p>

          <strong><p class="large">Average Foundation supports the idea of one - one person, one time, one small act of kindness.</p> </strong>

          <p>By funding your projects, I want to remove the financial pressures and help you get started in contributing and doing small acts of kindness for your community.</p>

          <p>At this point of the page, you may be wondering who I am and if I'm secretly Black Panther. If you're not,<a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#apply"> click here to move down the page.</a> For those of you who are still here, hi I'm Elisha!</p>

              <p>Here's a photo of me that you can hover over to reveal my secret identity.</p>
              <p>Yup, still me. ü§ó I'm passionate about bringing people together to solve big problems and I believe the way to have a meaningful life is to contribute and help others. </p>
              <p>My career allows me to be effective at designing and executing programs for tech + social good. With these skills and savings, I want to empower more people to start doing good.

That's not to be confused with personal stagnation though, growth is still important but enjoy the path to greatness knowing that it's okay if you don't reach the destination.
